impacting parallel processing performance.

o

3. Compare Primary and Secondary Partitioning of Hard Disk:

o Primary Partition: The main partition on the hard drive where 

the operating system is installed. A hard disk can have up to 4 

primary partitions.

o Secondary Partition (Extended Partition): Used to create 

additional logical drives on a hard disk, beyond the 4 primary 

partitions limit.

4. Windows Operating System with Specifications:

architectures, includes Cortana, DirectX 12, and 

Windows Defender.

▪ Windows 11: Released in 2021, supports newer 

hardware, redesigned interface, integrates Microsoft 

Teams, and improved virtual desktop management.

5. Two Core Processor Architecture and Multicore Processor 

Architecture:

o Two-Core Processor: A processor with two independent cores 

that can handle two tasks simultaneously.

o Multicore Processor: A processor with multiple cores (2, 4, 6, 

8, or more) that can handle multiple tasks or threads
simultaneously, improving performance and multitasking 

efficiency.

SET C

1. What is BIOS?

o BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is firmware embedded in 

the motherboard that initializes hardware during the boot 

process and provides runtime services for operating systems 

and programs.

o

2. Basic Structure of CPU:

o The CPU consists of the Control Unit (CU), which directs 

operations, and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which 

performs mathematical and logical operations. It also includes 

Registers for temporary data storage.

o

3. What is HDD?

o A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a mechanical storage device that 

uses spinning disks to read/write data. It is commonly used for 

long-term data storage in computers.

o FAT16: An older file system supports partitions up to 2GB.

o FAT32: Improved over FAT16, supports partitions up to 32GB, 

commonly used in USB drives.

o NTFS: The default file system for Windows, supports large 

files, file permissions, and encryption.

o EXT2/EXT3/EXT4: File systems used in Linux. EXT4 is the most 

recent and supports large file sizes and journaling.
